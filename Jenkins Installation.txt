Welcome to the Jenkins Installation
What is Jenkins? Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps you automate parts of software development, including:

Building (compiling and packaging code), Testing (running automated tests), Deploying (moving the software to production environments), and much more.

Think of Jenkins as a tool that takes away the manual steps in your development process and runs them automatically.

Why Jenkins? Continuous Integration (CI): Jenkins makes sure that every time you or your team makes a change in the code, it can be tested and built automatically. This helps catch bugs early.

Continuous Delivery (CD): Jenkins can automatically deploy your software to a production or test environment after successful builds.

Flexibility: Jenkins integrates with almost any tool out there (thanks to its plugins), from version control systems like Git to cloud services like AWS.

Job: A task you want Jenkins to execute (e.g., build your code, run tests). Build: A single execution of a job. Pipeline: A more advanced way of automating a series of jobs (steps) in sequence. Agent (Node): The machine where Jenkins runs your jobs. This can be the Jenkins server itself or a separate machine.

Installing Jenkins: sudo apt update sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y java -version
